Description: This package incorporates cyclic coordinate descent and
    majorization-minimization approaches to fit a variety of regression models
    found in large-scale observational healthcare data.  Implementations focus
    on computational optimization and fine-scale parallelization to yield
    efficient inference in massive datasets.
